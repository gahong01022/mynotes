### Flutter (a program language)
Flutter is an open source framework developed and supported by Google. Frontend and full-stack developers use Flutter to build an application’s user interface (UI) for multiple platforms with a single codebase.

When Flutter launched in 2018, it mainly supported mobile app development. Flutter now supports application development on six platforms: iOS, Android, the web, Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

>- Close-to-native performance.
>  Flutter uses the programming language Dart and compiles into machine code. Host devices understand this code, which ensures a fast and effective performance.
>- Fast, consistent, and customizable rendering.
>  Instead of relying on platform-specific rendering tools, Flutter uses Google’s open-source Skia graphic library to render UI. This provides users with consistent visuals no matter what platform they use to access an application. 
>- Developer-friendly tools.
>  Google built Flutter with an emphasis on ease-of-use. With tools like hot reload, developers can preview what code changes will look like without losing state. Other tools like the widget inspector make it easy to visualize and solve issues with UI layouts.
